	This Python module is tailored for historical lingustics. It allows you to create an object
representing a lexical item, apply linguistic mutations (either custom ones, or mutations from our
built-in library) to the object, and then find the form of the word throughout the past relative to
the mutations that you applied to it. This module is quite powerful and portable. We hope you enjoy!

	If you would like to submit your own mutations for the built-in file, feel free to fork it on
GitHub and edit mutations.py. I'd gladly add them to the original at your request.
